    <section class="intro">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Gambling is deeply rooted in Australian culture, spanning casinos,  
        lotteries, racing, and online platforms. Despite its appeal, it has  
        notable <strong>social and financial impacts</strong> nationwide.
      </p>

      <p>
        Australia ranks among the <strong>top gambling spenders</strong> per capita  
        globally, with billions lost each year across states and game types.
      </p>

      <p>
        This visualisation explores <strong>gambling behaviour, spending patterns,</strong>  
        and <strong>risk exposure</strong> to uncover how access, preference,  
        and policy shape Australia's gambling landscape.

      <h2>Gambling Loss per Adult by Australian State and Territory</h2>
      <div id="gambling_map"></div>

      <div class="story-text">
        <p>
          Gambling losses across Australia reveal clear regional contrasts,  
          shaped by <strong>population density, machine access,</strong> and  
          <strong>state-level regulation</strong>. The variation provides useful  
          insight into how local factors influence gambling behaviour.
        </p>

        <p>
          Average losses vary widely across Australia's states and territories.  
          <strong>New South Wales</strong> leads with around <strong>$1,550 per adult</strong> annually.  
          <strong>Queensland</strong> and <strong>Victoria</strong> follow with roughly  
          <strong>$1,150</strong> and <strong>$1,050</strong> respectively.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Western Australia</strong> records the lowest at about <strong>$670 per adult</strong>.  
          <strong>Tasmania</strong> and <strong>South Australia</strong> fall below the national average.  
          The <strong>Northern Territory</strong> shows elevated per-capita losses despite small population.
        </p>

        <p>
          The pattern highlights that greater gambling access and higher population density link  
          with higher losses per adult across regions.

      <h2>Expenditure Trends by Game Type</h2>
      <div id="line_chart"></div>

      <div class="story-text">
        <p>
          Gambling expenditure in Australia has evolved significantly over  
          the past two decades, reflecting <strong>economic shifts</strong> and  
          <strong>technological change</strong>. The long-term trend offers insight  
          into how <strong>digital access</strong> continues to reshape gambling behaviour.
        </p>

        <p>
          The data also captures key turning points — a <strong>steady climb during the 2000s</strong>,  
          a <strong>temporary dip around 2020</strong> caused by <strong>COVID-19 lockdowns</strong>,  
          and a <strong>rapid post-pandemic rebound</strong> as venues reopened and  
          <strong>online gambling surged</strong> amid growing digital convenience.
        </p>
              
        <p>
          Gambling expenditure in Australia has <strong>risen sharply since 1999</strong>, 
          reaching over <strong>$32 billion in 2024</strong>. 
          <strong>Gaming machines</strong> dominate spending, showing strong post-2020 recovery.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Wagering</strong> records the fastest growth, boosted by <strong>online betting platforms</strong> 
          and <strong>mobile access</strong>. 
          <strong>Casinos</strong> and <strong>lotteries</strong> remain stable, while <strong>minor gaming</strong> declines steadily.
        </p>

        <p>
          Overall, the data shows a <strong>shift toward digital gambling</strong>, 
          with online activity reshaping <strong>how Australians gamble and spend</strong>.

      <h2>Global Gambling Revenue Comparison</h2>
      <div id="global_gambling_chart"></div>

      <div class="story-text">

        <p>
          Gambling revenue varies widely across the world, shaped by  
          <strong>market size, culture,</strong> and <strong>regulation</strong>.  
          Comparing these figures highlights how economic and social  
          factors influence national gambling industries.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <strong>United States</strong> leads the world, generating over  
          <strong>$67 billion USD</strong> in annual gambling revenue —  
          far exceeding all other countries.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <strong>United Kingdom</strong>, <strong>France</strong>, and  
          <strong>Canada</strong> follow with earnings between  
          <strong>$12-18 billion USD</strong> each.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Australia</strong> ranks mid-level globally at about  
          <strong>$10 billion USD</strong>, reflecting high per-capita spending  
          despite its smaller population.
        </p>

        <p>
          These figures reveal that gambling remains a  
          <strong>major global economy</strong>, driven by accessibility,  
          technology, and evolving regulation.

      <h2>Gambling Preferences by Age Group</h2>
      <div id="age_gambling_chart"></div>
      <div class="story-text">
        <p>
          Gambling habits in Australia differ sharply by age,  
          shaped by <strong>technology, lifestyle, and income levels</strong>.  
          Younger adults are drawn to online and fast-paced formats,  
          while older groups prefer traditional, low-risk games.
        </p>

        <p>
          Gambling participation peaks among <strong>30-49 year olds</strong>,  
          who show the broadest engagement across all gambling types.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>18-29 year olds</strong> lean toward <strong>sports betting</strong>  
          and <strong>private betting</strong>, reflecting a preference for  
          fast, interactive forms of gambling.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>50-64 year olds</strong> maintain high involvement in  
          <strong>lotteries</strong> and <strong>gaming machines (EGMs)</strong>,  
          while the <strong>65+ group</strong> shows a decline across all types.
        </p>

        <p>
          The overall trend highlights that gambling intensity is  
          strongest in mid-life, when financial capacity and risk appetite  
          are highest.

      <h2>Gambling Activity vs Risk Group</h2>
      <div id="heatmap_chart"></div>
      <div class="story-text">
        <p>
          Gambling activity differs notably between risk groups,  
          showing how spending patterns shift from casual play  
          to high-intensity gambling. This relationship offers  
          insight into how <strong>risk level influences behaviour</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Non-problem gamblers</strong> show the highest participation in  
          <strong>lotteries (84%)</strong> and <strong>gaming machines (60%)</strong>,  
          reflecting controlled, recreational play.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Low-risk and moderate-risk groups</strong> engage moderately across  
          most activities, especially in <strong>casino games</strong> and  
          <strong>race betting</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Problem gamblers</strong> spend heavily on  
          <strong>gaming machines (61%)</strong> and  
          <strong>sports betting (47%)</strong>, highlighting a shift toward  
          high-intensity forms of gambling.
        </p>

        <p>
          The heatmap reveals that as risk severity rises,  
          gambling behaviour becomes more concentrated in  
          faster, higher-stakes activities.

      <h2>Sports Betting by Type</h2>
      <div id="sports_lollipop"></div>
      <div class="story-text">

        <p>
          Sports betting has surged in popularity, especially among  
          <strong>young to middle-aged Australians</strong> who are highly active  
          on <strong>digital and mobile platforms</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>AFL</strong> dominates with about <strong>58% participation</strong>,  
          followed by <strong>NRL (49%)</strong>,both reflecting Australia's  
          deep-rooted sporting culture.
        </p>

          Other major betting choices include <strong>soccer (28%)</strong>,  
          <strong>cricket (27%)</strong>, and <strong>basketball (25%)</strong>,  
          supported by global tournaments and online accessibility.
        </p>

        <p>
          The data highlights how <strong>digital wagering</strong> and  
          <strong>real-time sports engagement</strong> continue to drive  
          gambling growth among younger demographics.
